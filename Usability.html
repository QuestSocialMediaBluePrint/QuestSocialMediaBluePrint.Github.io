  <span style="color:#1c1917;">With over half of American adults reading below a 6th grade level and our key markets ranging between 7th and 10th grade reading levels on average, it's crucial that we create VR experiences that are easy to understand and engage with for users of all abilities, it's crucial that we create VR experiences that are easy to understand and engage with for users of all abilities. Below are some recommendations to help improve the usability and accessibility of your app:</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1c1917;">
    <strong>Use Reading Level Checkers</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">For general in-app text that doesn't contain sensitive info, utilize external tools like the Hemingway App or Readability Formulas. Aim for a reading level of 6th grade or lower.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">For sensitive content like terms of service, privacy policies, etc., use Microsoft Word's built-in readability statistics. Paste the text in Word and go to Review &gt; Proofing &gt; View Readability Statistics. Aim for:</span>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="color:#1c1917;">Flesch Reading Ease score of 60 or higher (higher is easier to read)</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color:#1c1917;">Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 6 or lower</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1c1917;">
    <strong>Simplify Language</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">Break up long, complex sentences into shorter, easier to digest chunks.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">Use active voice instead of passive voice. For example, "You created your account" rather than "Your account has been created."</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">Consider simpler synonyms over complex vocabulary. For instance, use "made an account" rather than "created an account."</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1c1917;">
    <strong>Supplement Text with Other Modes of Communication</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">In VR's spatial environment, textual explanations should not be the primary method of conveying information.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">Consider adding audio, images, videos, animations or NPC guides to demonstrate concepts and interactions.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">User testing indicates embodied guides providing verbal explanation along with physical demonstration greatly aids understanding compared to text alone.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1c1917;">
    <strong>Design Features for Ease of Understanding</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">Evaluate whether target users will readily comprehend how to use each of your app's features. If any functionality seems confusing, find ways to simplify or demonstrate its usage more clearly.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1c1917;">For warnings, violations or other corrective feedback, ensure users grasp what they did wrong and how to improve their behavior going forward. Unclear communications hamper progress.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1c1917;">Making readability and overall usability a priority in your VR design will create more engaging, accessible experiences that users of all abilities can readily enjoy.&nbsp;</span>
